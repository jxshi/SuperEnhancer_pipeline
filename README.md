# Introduction
Going from raw ChIP-seq reads to super-enhancer regions and comparing these regions within two groups can be a very tedious job. This pipeline was created to do this in a relative easy to use way. The pipeline features 6 clear steps (and 2 optinonal steps) that go from raw reads to super-enhancer regions and their associated genes.
